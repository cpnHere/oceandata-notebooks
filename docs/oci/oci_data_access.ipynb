    "<b>PREREQUISITES</b>\n",
    "<p>This notebook has the following prerequisites:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "    <a href=\"https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">An <b>Earthdata Login</b> account</a> is required to access data from the NASA Earthdata system, including NASA ocean color data.\n",

    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this notebook you will know:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to store your NASA Earthdata Login credentials with `earthaccess`\n",
    "* How to use `earthaccess` to search for PACE data using search filters\n",
    "* How to download PACE data, but only when you need to\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will use the `earthaccess` package to search for data collections from NASA Earthdata. This package, published on the [Python Package Index][pypi] and [conda-forge][conda], facilitates discovery and use of all NASA Earth Science data products by providing an abstraction layer for NASAâ€™s [Common Metadata Repository (CMR) API][cmr] and by simplifying requests to NASA's [Earthdata Cloud][edcloud]. Searching for data is more approachable using `earthaccess` than low-level HTTP requests, and the same goes for S3 requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, `earthaccess` helps **authenticate** with Earthdata Login, makes **search** easier, and provides a stream-lined way to **load data** into `xarray` containers. For more on `earthaccess`, visit the [documentation][earthaccess-docs] site. Be aware that `earthaccess` is under active development.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the discussions below on downloading and opening data, we need to clearly understand **where our notebook is running**. There are three cases to distinguish:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The notebook is running on the local host. For instance, you started a Jupyter server on your laptop.\n",
    "1. The notebook is running on a remote host, but it does not have direct access to the NASA Earthdata Cloud. For instance, you are running in [GitHub Codespaces][codespaces].\n",
    "1. The notebook is running on a remote host that does have direct access to the NASA Earthdata Cloud. At this time, we cannot provide a \"for instance\" which is available to everyone.\n",

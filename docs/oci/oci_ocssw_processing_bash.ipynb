    "[SeaDAS][seadas] is the official data analysis sofware of NASA's Ocean Biology Distributed Active Archive Center (OB. DAAC); used to process, display and analyse ocean color data. SeaDAS is a dektop application that includes SeaDAS-OCSSW, the core libraries or data processing components. There is a CLI for the SeaDAS-OCSSW data processing components, known simply as OCSSW, which we can use on a remote host without a desktop.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each bit in a bitmask represents a specific condition or flag (in the above example, clouds).\n",

    " - ```ds.l2_flags``` is the variable in our xarray dataset that contains the values for each pixel of the bitmask.\n",
    " - ```ds.l2_flags & (1 << bit_position)``` is basically saying to look only for pixels in the l2_flag variable where the specified bit is set. In other words, to look for pixels that have been flagged as a cloud.\n",
    " - ```~(ds.l2_flags & (1 << bit_position) != 0)```: The entire statement within the parentheses, with ```!= 0```, evaluates any pixel flagged cloudy as ```True```. Adding the ```~``` negates that condition, so that any pixel with the cloud flag set is evaluated to ```False```. We need these pixels to be False for the next step:\n",
    " - ```ds.where(~(ds.l2_flags & (1 << bit_position) != 0))```: ```xarray```'s ```.where``` function applies the mask to the entire dataset, which contains our surface reflectances. It keeps the pixel values which were evaluated to ```True``` in the step above, and assigns anything ```False``` as NaN. In other words, the cloudy pixels we set to \"False\" above have been set to NaN and therefore have been masked.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can apply multiple masks to the same datasets as well. Say you wanted to mask for clouds AND water, at the same time. There isn't a dedicated water masked, so instead we'll take the land mask at bit position 1 and invert it to mask out water. We can do that by leaving the ```~``` out of the statement, setting any non-land pixels to ```False``` like we did with clouds above:"

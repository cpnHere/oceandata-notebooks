    "Now that we have our surface reflectance data masked, we can start doing some analysis. A relatively simple but informative use of surface reflectance data is the calculation of vegetation indices (VIs). VIs use the well-known, idealized spectral shape of leaves and other materials to determine surface features contributing to a pixel. Vegetation health, relative water content, or even the presence of snow can be measured using VIs. They've been used in terrestrial remote sensing for decades, and are particularly valuable when considering the limited number of bands in previous multispectral sensors. They can, of course, also be calculated with hyperspectral sensors like PACE.\n",

To visualize the spectra, we want to plot across the wavelength dimension of individual pixels, so we'll take just a small sample from the dataset.

    "Comparing these two plots, we can see some similarities and differences. Generally, the patterns of high and low values fall in the same places - this is because NDVI is essentially measuring the amount of green vegetation, and CIRE is measuring the amount of green pigment in plants. However, CIRE also has a higher dynamic range than NDVI does. For one, NDVI saturates as vegetation density increases, so a wide range of ecosystems with varying amounts of green vegetation may have very similar NDVI values. On the other hand, CIRE is not as affected by the leaf area, and can instead hone in on the relative amount of chlorophyll pigment in a pixel rather than the amount of leaves. This is a major advantage of CIRE and other hyperspectral-enabled VIs like the Carotenoid Content Index (Car), enabling us to track specific biochemical shifts in plants that correspond to states of photosynthetic or photoprotective ability, and thus provide insight on plant physiological condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "If calculating these indices manually felt a little tedious, not to worry! PACE/OCI provides 10 VIs in its LANDVI products available in Level-2 (`short_name=\"PACE_OCI_L2_LANDVI\"`) and Level-3 (`short_name=\"PACE_OCI_L3M_LANDVI\"`). The suite includes 6 heritage indices and 4 narrowband pigment indices including CIRE. Read more about it in the ATBD (in review)."

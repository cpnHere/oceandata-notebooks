#
# ## Summary
#
# In this example we will use the `earthaccess` package to access an OCI Level-1B, Level-2, and Level-3 NetCDF file and open them using `xarray`.
#
# **NetCDF** ([Network Common Data Format][netcdf]) is a binary file format for storing multidimensional scientific data (variables). It is optimized for array-oriented data access and support a machine-independent format for representing scientific data. Files ending in `.nc` are NetCDF files.
#
# **XArray** is a [package][xarray] that supports the use of multi-dimensional arrays in Python. It is widely used to handle Earth observation data, which often involves multiple dimensions â€” for instance, longitude, latitude, time, and channels/bands.
#
# ## Learning Objectives
#
# At the end of this notebok you will know:
# * How to find groups in a NetCDF file
# * How to use `xarray` to open OCI data
# * What key variables are present in the groups within OCI L1B, L2, and L3 files

# ## 2. Inspecting OCI L1B File Structure
#
# Let's use `xarray` to open up a OCI L1B NetCDF file using `earthaccess`. We will use the same search method used in <a href="oci_data_access.html">OCI Data Access</a>. Note that L1B files do not include cloud coverage metadata, so we cannot use that filter.

# +
tspan = ("2024-05-01", "2024-05-16")
bbox = (-76.75, 36.97, -75.74, 39.01)

results = earthaccess.search_data(
    short_name="PACE_OCI_L1B_SCI",
    temporal=tspan,
    bounding_box=bbox,
)
# -

paths = earthaccess.open(results)

# We want to confirm we are running code on a remote host with direct access to the NASA Earthdata Cloud. The next cell has
# no effect if we are, and otherwise raises an error. If there's an error, consider the substitution explained in the OCI Data Access notebook.

try:
    paths[0].f.bucket
except AttributeError:
    raise "The result opened without an S3FileSystem."

# Let's open the first file of the L1B files list:

dataset = xr.open_dataset(paths[0])
dataset

# Notice that this `xarray.Dataset` has nothing but "Attributes". We cannot use `xarray` to open multi-group hierarchies or list groups within a NetCDF file, but it can open a specific group if you know its path. The `xarray-datatree` package is going to be merged into `xarray` in the not too distant future, which will allow `xarray` to open the entire hieerarchy. In the meantime, we can use a lower level reader to see the top-level groups.

with h5netcdf.File(paths[0]) as file:
    groups = list(file)
groups

# Let's open the "observation_data" group, which contains the core science variables.

dataset = xr.open_dataset(paths[0], group="observation_data")
dataset

# Now you can view the Dimensions, Coordinates, and Variables of this group. To show/hide attributes, press the paper icon on the right hand side of each variable. To show/hide data reprensetaton, press the cylinder icon. For instance, you could check the attributes on "rhot_blue" to see that this variable is the "Top of Atmosphere Blue Band Reflectance".
#
# The dimensions of the "rhot_blue" variable are ("blue_bands", "number_of_scans", "ccd_pixels"), and it has shape (119, 1709, 1272). The `sizes` attribute of a variable gives us that information as a dictionary.

dataset["rhot_blue"].sizes

# Let's plot the reflectance at postion 100 in the "blue_bands" dimension.

plot = dataset["rhot_blue"].sel({"blue_bands": 100}).plot()

# ## 3. Inspecting OCI L2 File Structure
#
# OCI L2 files include retrievals of geophysical variables, such as Apparent Optical Properties (AOP), for each L1 swath. We'll use the same `earthaccess` search for L2 AOP data. Although now we can use `cloud_cover` too.

# -

paths = earthaccess.open(results)

with h5netcdf.File(paths[0]) as file:
    groups = list(file)
groups

# Let's look at the "geophysical_data" group, which is a new group generated by the level 2 processing.

dataset = xr.open_dataset(paths[0], group="geophysical_data")
rrs = dataset["Rrs"]
rrs

rrs.sizes

# The Rrs variable has length 184 in the wavelength dimension, so the blue, red, and SWIR wavelengths have been combined. Let's map the Rrs at "wavelength_3d" position 100.

plot = rrs.sel({"wavelength_3d": 100}).plot(cmap="viridis")

# Right now, the scene is being plotted using `number_of_lines` and `pixels_per_line` as "x" and "y", respectively. We need to add latitude and longitude values to create a true map. To do this, we will create a merged `xarray.Dataset` that pulls in information from the "navigation_data" group.

dataset = xr.open_dataset(paths[0], group="navigation_data")
dataset = dataset.set_coords(("longitude", "latitude"))
dataset = dataset.rename({"pixel_control_points": "pixels_per_line"})
dataset = xr.merge((rrs, dataset.coords))
dataset

# Although we now have coordinates, they won't immediately help because the data are not gridded by latitude and longitude.
# The Level 2 data cover the original instrument swath and have not been resampled to a regular grid. Therefore latitude
# and longitude are known, but cannot be used immediately to "look-up" values like you can along an array's dimensions.
#
# Let's make a scatter plot of the pixel locations so we can see the irregular spacing. By selecting a `slice` with a step size larger than one, we get a subset of the locations for better visualization.

plot = dataset.sel(
    {
        "number_of_lines": slice(None, None, 1720 // 20),
        "pixels_per_line": slice(None, None, 1272 // 20),
    },
).plot.scatter(x="longitude", y="latitude")

# Let's plot this new `xarray.Dataset` the same way as before, but add latitude and longitude.

rrs = dataset["Rrs"].sel({"wavelength_3d": 100})
plot = rrs.plot(x="longitude", y="latitude", cmap="viridis", vmin=0)

# Now you can project the data onto a grid. If you wanna get fancy, add a coastline.

fig = plt.figure()
ax = plt.axes(projection=ccrs.PlateCarree())
ax.coastlines()
ax.gridlines(draw_labels={"left": "y", "bottom": "x"})
plot = rrs.plot(x="longitude", y="latitude", cmap="viridis", vmin=0, ax=ax)

# Let's plot the full "Rrs" spectrum for individual pixels. A visualization with all the pixels
# wouldn't be useful, but limiting to a bounding box gives a simple way to subset pixels. Note that,
# since we still don't have gridded data (i.e. our latitude and longitude coordinates are two-dimensional),
# we can't `slice` on a built-in index. Without getting into anything complex, we can just box it out.

rrs_box = dataset["Rrs"].where(
    (
        (dataset["latitude"] > 37.52)
        & (dataset["latitude"] < 37.55)
        & (dataset["longitude"] > -75.46)
        & (dataset["longitude"] < -75.43)
    ),
    drop=True,
)
rrs_box.sizes

# The line plotting method will only draw a line plot for 1D data, which we can get by stacking
# our two spatial dimensions and choosing to show the new "pixel dimension" as different colors.

rrs_stack = rrs_box.stack(
    {"pixel": ["number_of_lines", "pixels_per_line"]},
    create_index=False,
)
plot = rrs_stack.plot.line(hue="pixel")

# We will go over how to plot Rrs spectra with accurate wavelength values on the x-axis in an upcoming notebook.

# ## 4. Inspecting OCI L3 File Structure
#
# At Level-3 there are binned (B) and mapped (M) products available for OCI. The L3M remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) files contain global maps of Rrs. We'll use the same `earthaccess` method to find the data.

# +
tspan = ("2024-05-01", "2024-05-16")
bbox = (-76.75, 36.97, -75.74, 39.01)

results = earthaccess.search_data(
    short_name="PACE_OCI_L3M_RRS_NRT",
    temporal=tspan,
    bounding_box=bbox,
)
# -

paths = earthaccess.open(results)

# OCI L3 data do not have any groups, so we can open the dataset without the `group` argument.
# Let's take a look at the first file.

dataset = xr.open_dataset(paths[0])
dataset

# Notice that OCI L3M data has `lat` and `lon` coordinates, so it's easy to slice out a bounding box and map the "Rrs_442" variable.

# +
fig = plt.figure()
ax = plt.axes(projection=ccrs.PlateCarree())
ax.coastlines()
ax.gridlines(draw_labels={"left": "y", "bottom": "x"})

rrs_442 = dataset["Rrs_442"].sel({"lat": slice(-25, -45), "lon": slice(10, 30)})
plot = rrs_442.plot(cmap="viridis", vmin=0, ax=ax)
# -
# Also becuase the L3M variables have `lat` and `lon` coordinates, it's possible to stack multiple granules along a
# new dimension that corresponds to time.
# Instead of `xr.open_dataset`, we use `xr.open_mfdataset` to create a single `xarray.Dataset` (the "mf" in `open_mfdataset` stands for multiple files) from an array of paths.
#
# We also use a new search filter available in `earthaccess.search_data`: the `granule_name` argument accepts strings with the "*" wildcard. We need this to distinguish daily ("DAY") from eight-day ("8D") composites, as well as to get the 0.1 degree resolution projections.

# +
tspan = ("2024-05-01", "2024-05-8")

results = earthaccess.search_data(
    short_name="PACE_OCI_L3M_CHL_NRT",
    temporal=tspan,
    granule_name="*.DAY.*.0p1deg.*",
)
# -

paths = earthaccess.open(results)

# The `paths` list is sorted temporally by default, which means the shape of the `paths` array specifies the way we need to tile the files together into larger arrays. We specify `combine="nested"` to combine the files according to the shape of the array of files (or file-like objects), even though `paths` is not a "nested" list in this case. The `concat_dim="date"` argument generates a new dimension in the combined dataset, because "date" is not an existing dimension in the individual files.

dataset = xr.open_mfdataset(
    paths,
    combine="nested",
    concat_dim="date",
)

# Add a date dimension using the dates from the netCDF files.

dates = [ xr.open_dataset(a).attrs["time_coverage_end"] for a in paths]
dt = pd.to_datetime(dates)
dataset = dataset.assign_coords(date=dt.values)
dataset

# A common reason to generate a single dataset from multiple, daily images is to create a composite. Compare the map from a single day ...

chla = np.log10(dataset["chlor_a"])
chla.attrs.update(
    {
        "units": f'lg({dataset["chlor_a"].attrs["units"]})',
    }
)
plot = chla.sel(date = "2024-05-02").plot(aspect=2, size=4, cmap="GnBu_r")

# ... to a map of average values, skipping "NaN" values that result from clouds and the OCI's tilt maneuver.

chla_avg = chla.mean("date")
chla_avg.attrs.update(
    {
        "long_name": chla.attrs["long_name"],
        "units": chla.attrs["units"],
    }
)
plot = chla_avg.plot(aspect=2, size=4, cmap="GnBu_r")

# We can also create a time series of mean values over the whole region.

chla.mean(dim=["lon", "lat"]).plot();

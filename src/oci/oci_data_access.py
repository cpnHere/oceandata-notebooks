# <b>PREREQUISITES</b> 
#     
# This notebook has the following prerequisites:
# - **<a href="https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/" target="_blank"> An Earthdata Login account</a>** is required to access data from the NASA Earthdata system, including NASA ocean color data.
#
# There are no prerequisite notebooks for this module.
# </div>

# ## Learning objectives
#
# At the end of this notebook you will know:
#
# * How to authenticate with `earthaccess`
# * How to use `earthaccess` to search for PACE data using search filters
# * How to download PACE data
#
# ## Summary
#
# In this example we will use the `earthaccess` library to search for data collections from NASA Earthdata. `earthaccess` is a Python library that simplifies data discovery and access to NASA Earth science data by providing an abstraction layer for NASAâ€™s [Common Metadata Repository (CMR) API](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/site/docs/search/api.html) Search API. The library makes searching for data more approachable by using a simpler notation instead of low level HTTP queries. `earthaccess` takes the trouble out of Earthdata Login **authentication**, makes **search** easier, and provides a stream-line way to download or stream search results into an `xarray` object.
#
# For more on `earthaccess` visit the [`earthaccess` GitHub](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess) page and/or the [`earthaccess` documentation](https://earthaccess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) site. Be aware that `earthaccess` is under active development.

#
# </div>

# We begin by importing all of the libraries that we need to run this notebook. If you have created an environment following the [guidance] provided with this notebook, then the packages will be sucessfully imported.

import earthaccess

# <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
#
# ## <a id='section1'>1. Authentication for NASA Earthdata
# [Back to top](#TOC_TOP)
#
# </div>

# Next, we authenticate using our Earthdata Login credentials. Authentication is not necessarily needed to search for publicaly available data collections in Earthdata, but is always need to download or access data from the NASA Earthdata archives. We can use the `login` method from the `earthaccess` package. This will create a authenticated session with provided Earthdata Login username and password. The `earthaccess` package will search for credentials defined by **environmental variables** or within a **.netrc** file save in the home/user profile directory. If credentials are not found, an interactive prompt will allow you to input credentials. The `persist=True` argument ensures any discovered credentials
# are stored in a `.netrc` file, so the argument is not necessary (but it's also harmless) for subsequent calls to `earthaccess.login`.
#

auth = earthaccess.login(persist=True)

# <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
#
# ## <a id='section2'>2. Search for data
# [Back to top](#TOC_TOP)
#
# </div>

# There are multiple keywords we can use to discovery data from collections. We will use the `short_name` to find data. The `count` argument limits the number of granules returned in the `results` list.

results = earthaccess.search_data(
    short_name = "PACE_OCI_L2_AOP_NRT",
    cloud_hosted = True,
    count = 10,
)

# We can refine our search by passing more parameters that describe the spatiotemporal domain of our use case. Here, we use the `temporal` parameter to request a date range and the `bounding_box` parameter to request granules that intersect with a bounding box. We can even provide a `cloud_cover` threshold to limit files that have a lower percetnage of cloud cover

dates = ("2024-04-01", "2024-04-16")
bbox = (-76.75, 36.97, -75.74, 39.01)
clouds = (0, 50)

results = earthaccess.search_data(
    short_name = "PACE_OCI_L2_AOP_NRT",
    cloud_hosted = True,
    temporal = dates,
    bounding_box = bbox, 
    cloud_cover = clouds,
)

# The `display` function provides an rich display associated with each result. In this case, you see a direct download link. The link will open a new browser tab and download the data file to your local machine, which is not what you need to do for "in-region" access.

for item in results:
    display(item)

# TODO: describe how this is only to download locally or have seperate notebook that uses earthaccess.download ? 
# explain alt: section 4- Access data in cloud? use data in the cloud instead of download data. and explain how all other notebooks will follow that format. 
#
# TODO maybe: include text on different file systems. e.g. S3 or HTTPS

# A quick way to do a direct download is to list the results and press on the link to download each file individually. 

results[0]

# +
# to list all you can uncomment and run:
#[display(r) for r in results]
# -

# In some cases you may want to download multiple files at once. `earthaccess` makes downloading the data from the search results very easy using the `earthaccess.download()` function. Files will be downloaded in 'local_path'.

downloaded_files = earthaccess.download(
    results[0],
    local_path='storage/',
)

# If you have completed this section, you can now continue to work through the rest of the notebooks in the repository and learn more about working with PACE data.
